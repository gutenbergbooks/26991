and Custom are the Rules and Measures of every
</i>
Language,
<i>
and the Rules of
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar
</span>
<i>
have nothing more to do, than to teach it. The
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar
</span>
<i>
is to be fashioned from the particular
</i>
Language,
<i>
it treats of, and not the Language from the
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar</span>.
<i>
For want of following this regular Plan, our Modern
</i>
GRAMMARIANS
<i>
have introduced the
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar
</span>
Rules
<i>
of other
</i>
Languages
<i>
into their own; as if all
</i>
Language
<i>
was founded on
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar</span>,
<i>
and the Rules in one
</i>
Language
<i>
would serve the same End and Purpose in another.
</i>
</p>
<p>
The Latin,
<i>
for Instance, has only
</i>
eight Parts of Speech,
<i>
and the Writers of
</i>
English
<span class="sc">
Grammar
</span>
<i>
have unthinkingly adopted the same Number; whereas with the Article,
<span class="pagenum">
[iv]
</span>
which the
</i>
Latin
<i>
has not, and which is of great Service in a
</i>
Language,
<i>
we have no less than nine. The
</i>
Latin
<i>
admits of
</i>
Cases;
<i>
but as different
</i>
Cases,
<i>
properly speaking, are nothing more than the different Inflections and Terminations of Nouns</i>, English Nouns
<i>
have no
</i>
Cases.
<i>
It is not agreeable to the Principles of
</i>
<span class="sc">
Grammar
</span>
<i>
to say that</i>&#8212;of a Rose&#8212;<i>is the Genitive Case of</i>&#8212;Rose,
<i>
or</i>&#8212;to a Rose,
<i>
the Dative; for
</i>
of
<i>
and
</i>
to
<i>
are no Part of the Word
</i>
Rose,
<i>
but only
</i>
prefix Particles
<i>
or
</i>
Prepositions,
<i>
which shew the different Relation of the Word
</i>
Rose.
<i>
So likewise when we say
</i>
Alexander's Horse,
<i>
the Word
</i>
Alexander's
<i>
is not the Genitive Case of
</i>
Alexander;
<i>
for strictly speaking the
</i>
's
<i>
is no Part of the Word
</i>
Alexander
<i>
but the final Letter of the Pronoun Possessive
</i>
his,
<i>
and without the
</i>
Apostrophe
<i>
we shou'd read it thus;
</i>
Alexander his Horse.
<i>
If any of the
</i>
Parts of Speech
<i>
have
</i>
Cases,
<i>
the
</i>
Pronouns
<i>
have, and some of the
</i>
Pronouns
<i>
may perhaps have
</i>
two;
<i>
but for the Sake of making every Thing as easy as I can to the Learner, I have taken the Liberty of distinguishing such
</i>
Pronouns
<i>
into
</i>
Prefix
<i>
and
</i>
Subsequent,
<i>
and entirely laid aside
</i>
Cases
<i>
as useless and unnecessary. The
</i>
Latin
<i>
has
</i>
Genders,
<i>
the
</i>
Adjective
<i>
in
<span class="pagenum">
[v]
</span>
that Language always varying to correspond with the
</i>
Substantive;
<i>
but our</i>Adjectives
<i>
never vary, and therefore the Distinction of
</i>
Genders
<i>
has nothing to do with
</i>
English
<span class="sc">
Grammar</span>,
<i>
but is idle, trifling, impertinent.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Experience
</span>
<i>
shews, that this Sort of pedantick Ignorance and Folly, has made that dark and obscure, which it was intended to elucidate, and unhappily puzzled and perplexed a great many more, than it has ever instructed. Every attempt to make
</i>
English easy
<i>
must be fruitless, that is not formed upon a different Plan, and such is the following
</i>
short System of English

Plural</i>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">
[6]
</span>
When a Thing is considered as single, or a Multitude of Things considered as united together, it is of the
<i>
Singular Number</i>; as
<i>
a Man</i>,
<i>
a Troop</i>.
</p>
<p>
When several Things are considered as distinct from each other it is of the
<i>
Plural Number</i>, as
<i>
Men</i>,
<i>
Soldiers</i>.
</p>
<p>
The
<i>
Plural
</i>
is usually formed in
<i>
Noun Substantives
</i>
by adding
<i>
s
</i>
to the
<i>
Singular</i>; as
<i>
Article Articles</i>,
<i>
Noun Nouns</i>.
</p>
<p>
But when the Pronunciation requires it, or when the
<i>
Singular
</i>
ends in
<i>
s</i>,
<i>
x</i>,
<i>
sh</i>, or
<i>
ch</i>, the
<i>
Plural
</i>
is usually formed by adding the Syllable
<i>
es</i>; as
<i>
Ass Asses</i>,
<i>
Fox Foxes</i>,
<i>
Sash Sashes</i>,
<i>
Church Churches</i>.
</p>
<p>
When the
<i>
Singular
</i>
ends in
<i>
f
</i>
or
<i>
fe</i>, the
<i>
Plural
</i>
is usually form'd by changing the
<i>
f
</i>
or
<i>
fe
</i>
into
<i>
ves</i>; as
<i>
Wife Wives</i>,
<i>
Self Selves</i>.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the
<i>
Plural
</i>
is formed by adding the Syllable
<i>
en</i>; as
<i>
Ox Oxen</i>; sometimes by changing the
<i>
Vowel</i>; as
<i>
Man Men</i>; and sometimes the
<i>
Vowels and Consonants</i>; as
<i>
Penny Pence</i>,
<i>
Mouse Mice</i>,
<i>
Louse Lice</i>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">
[7]
</span>
Some of the
<i>
Pronouns
</i>
form their
<i>
Plural
</i>
very irregular; as
<i>
I We</i>,
<i>
Me Us</i>,
<i>
Thou Ye</i>,
<i>
Thee You</i>,
<i>
He They</i>,
<i>
Him Them</i>,
<i>
She They</i>,
<i>
Her Them</i>.
</p>
<p>
Some
<i>
Nouns
</i>
have no
<i>
Singular Number</i>; as
<i>
Scissors</i>, the
<i>
East-Indies</i>, the
<i>
West-Indies</i>.
</p>
<p>
Some have no
<i>
Plural</i>; the Names of Kingdoms for Instance; as
<i>
England</i>,
<i>
Ireland</i>,
<i>
Portugal</i>.
</p>
<p>
Cities, Towns and Villages; as
<i>
Worcester</i>,
<i>
Kinver</i>,
<i>
Hagley</i>.
</p>
<p>
Seas, and Rivers; as the
<i>
Mediterranean</i>,
<i>
Severn</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Wheat</i>,
<i>
Barley</i>,
<i>
Gold</i>,
<i>
Silver</i>,
<i>
Pewter</i>, and a great many Words, that cannot be reduced to any Rule want the

Plural Number</i>; as

Ale</i>,

Beer</i>,
<i>
Bread</i>,
<i>
Butter</i>,
<i>
Honey</i>,
<i>
Milk</i>,
<i>
Hunger</i>,
<i>
Thirst</i>,
<i>
Drunkenness</i>.
</p>
<p>
The Termination of some
<i>
Nouns
</i>
is the same both in the
<i>
Singular
</i>
and
<i>
Plural</i>; as
<i>
a Sheep</i>,
<i>
a Swine</i>, a Flock of

</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Adjectives</span>,

Adverbs</i>, and

Positive</i>, the

</p>
<p>
The
<i>
Positive
</i>
lays down the Natural Signification simply and without excess or Diminution; as

long</i>,
<i>
short</i>,
<i>
often</i>.
</p>
<p>
The

Comparative
</i>
raises or lowers the

Positive
</i>
in Signification, and is formed of the

Positive
</i>
by adding the Syllable
<i>
er</i>; as

long longer</i>,
<i>
short shorter</i>,
<i>
often oftener</i>.
</p>
<p>
The
<i>
Superlative
</i>
raises or lowers the Signification as much as possible, and if formed of the

Positive
</i>
by adding the Syllable
<span class="pagenum">

These

bad worse worst</i>,
<i>
little less least</i>,
<i>

</p>
<p>
<span class="sc">
Substantives

are compared by the

<i>
more, most</i>, the Words

A Verb
<i>
Active
</i>
is that which expresses an
<i>
Action</i>; as
<i>
I kick</i>,
<i>
I see</i>.
</p>
<p>
A Verb
<i>
Passive
</i>
is that which receives the
<i>
Action
</i>
or expresses the
<i>
Passion</i>; as
<i>
I am kick'd</i>,
<i>
I am seen</i>.

A Verb has two
<i>
Numbers
</i>
the
<i>
Singular
</i>
and the
<i>
Plural</i>; and three
<i>
Persons
</i>
in each
<i>
Number</i>; as
<i>
I am, thou art, he is</i>.
<i>
We are, ye are, they are.

nor Person.

<p>
A Noun
<i>
Substantive
</i>
is usually placed after its
<i>
Noun Adjective</i>; as the
<i>
Second Chapter</i>, a
<i>
great Man</i>. But sometimes for the Sake of greater Distinction the
<i>
Adjective
</i>
is placed after, with the Article
<i>
the
</i>
before it, as
<i>
George the Second</i>,
<i>
Peter the Great</i>. In
<i>
Poetry
</i>
the
<i>
Adjective
</i>
is placed either before or after its
<i>
Substantive
</i>
indifferently, as the Versification requires it.
</p>
<p class="ctr">

<p>
All
<i>
Nouns and Pronouns
</i>
are of the
<i>
third Person
</i>
except
<i>
I and we</i>, which are of the
<i>
first Person</i>, and
<i>
Thou, you and ye</i>, which are of the
<i>
Second Person</i>; and except
<span class="pagenum">
[39]
</span>
the
<i>
Relative Pronouns
</i>
which are always of the

</i>
with the

Personal Pronoun

I love, thou lovest, he loveth; I who love, Thou who lovest, he who loveth</i>.
</p>
<p class="ctr">
<span class="sc">
Rule

</p>
<p>
The
<i>
prefix Pronouns</i>,
<i>
I, we, thou, you, ye, he, she, they, who</i>, are usually placed before the
<i>
Verb</i>; and the
<i>
Subsequent Pronouns</i>,
<i>
me, us, thee, him, her, them, whom</i>, are usually placed after; as
<i>
I love the Dog, the Dog loves me</i>. But when a
<i>
Question
</i>
is asked, or when the
<i>
Verb
</i>
is of the
<i>
Imperative Mood</i>, or in short Sentences, the
<i>
prefix Pronouns
</i>
are usually placed after; as

lovest thou me? love thou thyself, said he, said they</i>.
</p>
<p class="ctr">
<span class="sc">

</p>
<p>
When a Question is asked, and the
<i>
Verb
</i>
has an
<i>
Auxiliary Sign</i>, or an
<i>
Auxiliary Verb</i>, the
<i>
governing Noun
</i>
or
<i>
Pronoun
</i>
is placed immediately after such
<i>
Auxiliary</i>; as
<i>
does the Sun shine? has he washed his
<span class="pagenum">
[40]
</span>
Hands?
</i>
And when the
<i>
Verb
</i>
has two or more
<i>
Auxiliaries</i>, the
<i>
Noun or Pronoun

is placed after the first; as
<i>
have I been taught? Cou'd the Truth have been known?
</i>
</p>
<p class="ctr">
<span class="sc">
Rule

</p>
<p>
The
<i>
Verb
</i>
agrees with its
<i>
governing Noun</i>,
<i>
Pronoun Personal</i>, or
<i>
Pronoun Relative</i>, in
<i>
Number
</i>
and
<i>
Person</i>; as
<i>
the Birds sing</i>,

thou lovest</i>,

he who loveth</i>.

A

Verb

either

Singular

or

Plural</i>; as

the People are mad</i>.
</p>
<p>
But if a

Substantive
</i>
of the same Signification follows, that is not a
<i>
Noun of Multitude</i>, then the

Verb
</i>
is always Plural; as we do not say
<i>
the People is a mad Man</i>, but

the People are mad Men</i>.

<span class="sc">

</p>
<p>
Two or more

Nouns

or

Pronouns Singular</i>, will have a

Verb Plural</i>; as
<i>
the Dog and Cat are very loving</i>. But when
<span class="pagenum">
[41]
</span>
two or more

Substantives Singular
</i>
signify the same
<i>
Thing
</i>
or
<i>
Person</i>, or when the

Preposition

<span class="sc">
OF

intervenes, the

is always

Singular</i>; as

William the Conqueror was a great Man.

<p>
The
